- JEE Advanced Marking scheme: Time : 3 Hours Maximum Marks : 180 PART – 1 : PHYSICS SECTION 1 (Maximum Marks: 12) • This section contains THREE (03) questions. • Each question has FOUR options (A), (B), (C) and (D). ONE OR MORE THAN ONE of these four option(s) is(are) correct answer(s). • For each question, choose the option(s) corresponding to (all) the correct answer(s). • Answer to each question will be evaluated according to the following marking scheme: Full Marks : +4 ONLY if (all) the correct option(s) is(are) chosen; Partial Marks : +3 If all the four options are correct but ONLY three options are chosen; Partial Marks : +2 If three or more options are correct but ONLY two options are chosen, both of which are correct; Partial Marks : +1 If two or more options are correct but ONLY one option is chosen and it is a correct option; Zero Marks : 0 If none of the options is chosen (i.e. the question is unanswered); Negative Marks : −2 In all other cases. • For example, in a question, if (A), (B) and (D) are the ONLY three options corresponding to correct answers, then choosing ONLY (A), (B) and (D) will get +4 marks; choosing ONLY (A) and (B) will get +2 marks; choosing ONLY (A) and (D) will get +2 marks; choosing ONLY (B) and (D) will get +2 marks; choosing ONLY (A) will get +1 mark; choosing ONLY (B) will get +1 mark; choosing ONLY (D) will get +1 mark; choosing no option (i.e. the question is unanswered) will get 0 marks; and choosing any other combination of options will get -2 marks. SECTION 2 (Maximum Marks: 12) This section contains FOUR (04) questions. • Each question has FOUR options (A), (B), (C) and (D). ONLY ONE of these four options is the correct answer. • For each question, choose the option corresponding to the correct answer. • Answer to each question will be evaluated according to the following marking scheme: Full Marks : +3 If ONLY the correct option is chosen; Zero Marks : 0 If none of the options is chosen (i.e. the question is unanswered); Negative Marks : −1 In all other cases. SECTION 3 (Maximum Marks: 24) • This section contains SIX (06) questions. • The answer to each question is a NON-NEGATIVE INTEGER. • For each question, enter the correct integer corresponding to the answer using the mouse and the onscreen virtual numeric keypad in the place designated to enter the answer. • Answer to each question will be evaluated according to the following marking scheme: Full Marks : +4 If ONLY the correct integer is entered; Zero Marks : 0 In all other cases. SECTION 4 (Maximum Marks: 12) This section contains FOUR (04) Matching List Sets. • Each set has ONE Multiple Choice Question. • Each set has TWO lists: List-I and List-II. • List-I has Four entries (P), (Q), (R) and (S) and List-II has Five entries (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5). • FOUR options are given in each Multiple Choice Question based on List-I and List-II and ONLY ONE of these four options satisfies the condition asked in the Multiple Choice Question. • Answer to each question will be evaluated according to the following marking scheme: Full Marks : +3 ONLY if the option corresponding to the correct combination is chosen; Zero Marks : 0 If none of the options is chosen (i.e. the question is unanswered); • Negative Marks : –1 In all other cases. Same applies for chemistry and mathematics # JEE Main marking scheme: Time : 3 Hours Maximum Marks : 300 PART - 1 : PHYSICS • This question paper contains two sections , section A & B. • Section A contains 20 multiple choice questions (MCQs) with four options (A),(B),(C),(D) out of which only one option is correct. • Section B contains 5 Numerical Value Type questions. Section A • This Section contain 20 questions (Q.No. 1 to Q.No. 20) • Answer to each question in Section A will be evaluated according to the following marking scheme: Full Marks : +4 for correct answer Zero Marks : 0 If the question is unanswered; Negative Marks : –1 for incorrect answer Section B • This Section contain 5 questions (Q.No. 21 to Q.No. 25) whose answer to be filled as numerical value • Answer to each question in Section B will be evaluated according to the following marking scheme: Full Marks : +4 for correct answer Zero Marks : 0 If the question is unanswered; Zero Marks : 0 for incorrect answer Same applies for chemistry and mathematics
